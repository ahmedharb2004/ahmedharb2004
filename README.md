I'm a Full-Stack developer who likes to work with JavaScript/Typescript (Preact, Next.js, TensorFlow.js, Node, Deno) Rust, Python among others.

A few years ago I realized that I wanted to focus my efforts on being useful. For this reason, I'm trying to contribute more and more to open-source projects, helping people on Discus, StackOverflow, Spectrum, Github discussions... and creating useful content to be used by developers: libraries and articles.
